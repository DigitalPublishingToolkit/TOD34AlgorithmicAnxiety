#Acknowledgements 

It took a vast constellation of relations to write this book. These relations reach widely and vary greatly in their relationship to me, this work, this life. They cross vast spaces and times, species, and disciplines. Together they underscore the many interrelations, unexpected connections and alliances, and transformative encounters that make up this work, this life, me. I acknowledge that I am thoroughly dependent on and carried by all of yous. My gratitude is profound. 

I am deeply indebted to my supervisors at Erasmus University Rotterdam and Maastricht University. My gratitude goes out to Willem Schinkel. Willem has been a tremendous support, and I join many others in paying homage to him and acknowledging his intellectual generosity, mentorship, friendship and brilliance with which he helped me to think through and improve my ideas. I am grateful to Karin Wenz, who saw this project through to its completion, for her detailed and insightful commentaries, her warm support, her interdisciplinary expertise, and for being a gentle soul. And I am thankful to Jess Bier, for her sparkly energy, fantastic feedback and stellar hands-on suggestions. 
 
I want to thank the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences, the Faculty of Digital Media and Creative Industries, for giving me the opportunity to write this book. Without their support, I would not be writing these acknowledgements. My sincere gratitude goes out to Geert Lovink, who stimulated me to pursue a Ph.D., for his tireless support and generosity, for being an uncompromising spirit, a source of inspiration, and for always asking the right questions. 

In 2017/2018 I spent a semester as a writer in residence at Digital Asia Hub in Hong Kong, which was an invaluable experience. I want to give a shout-out to Malavika Jayaram for inviting me to work with her, which was a delight, and for being such a generous human being whose spirit helped shape this book. 

Important parts of this book have been written in research environments I was lucky enough to be able to work in: the Netherlands Institute Turkey in Istanbul, Royal Netherlands Institute in Rome, Hong Kong University and Chinese University of Hong Kong. I am deeply appreciative of Adreas Treske, Su Gokce, Rosi Braidotti, Hollie Mackenzie, Anir Halder, Diana Teggi, Katie Guinnane, Donatella della Ratta, Richard Rogers, Jack Qiu, Ying Chan, Sam Chua, Dev Lewis, Rolien Hoying, Saskia Witteborn, Maggie Leung, Johanna Pezold, Nadim Abbas, Angela Dhalaigh, Anna Fiedler, Ashley Wong, Iris Hoiting and Anya Rangaswami for adding fluorescent colours to this trajectory.

I am grateful to Glenn and Orlando Gemerts, Michele Aboro, Caby Balentine, Marcel Smith, Marie-Christine Nicolas and Ilse Twigt who showed me the ropes and taught me how to fight. I am deeply indebted to Boukje Janssen, Marjanne Tamminga, Ammelie van Beurden, Frank de Roos, Marcel Prins, Merel Kuiper for their wisdom and for teaching me how to swim upstream. For reminding me of the existence of different temporalities and of the importance of the larger ethics of things, I want to thank Sibbe, Toru and Ack Tjal.  

I want to thank my sister, a giant in generosity, in strength, in courage, in encouragement, and in sisterhood, and my mom for her unconditional love, her calm endurance, and for being right beside me, always.
